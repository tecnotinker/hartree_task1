# hartree_task1

I've ended up with a solution using a straight line and a code that allows me to mount the sample data over this straight line defined by the endpoints, after I sent the project I got the feeling that this was not te best solution but as I just finished a similar functionality for a project I'm currently working on, it seemed to me as the best call at the time, also I choose to do a visual implementation of the solution again because this is something that I'm currently working on, thanks for the time to review my code and I will be happy to get your thoughts on it.
